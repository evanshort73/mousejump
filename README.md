# MouseJump
AceJump-inspired interface for moving the mouse by keyboard or voice

The program is currently in a finished and usable state.

`mousejump.cpp` is the single self-contained file you need to build the program.
Build instructions are in `mousejump.cpp`.

`.atom-build.js` enables one-button build within Atom, using https://atom.io/packages/build


- **Number keys:** Move cursor to label

- **Enter:** Click with primary button

- **"Apps" key (the one with the picture of a context menu):** Click with secondary button

- **Tab:** Middle-click

- **Arrow keys:** Move cursor AND labels

- **Space:** Other commands now choose drag destination instead of moving cursor


I control MouseJump using Vocola voice commands that press these keys for me.
My full voice command setup is here: https://github.com/evanshort73/mypersonalvcl
